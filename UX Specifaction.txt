Page Behavior

- Upon initial loading, the User Management screen should display the user table with all user accounts, including their ID, User Name, Email, and Enabled status.
- Administrators can click the "Hide Disabled User" checkbox to filter out disabled users from the table.
- Administrators can fill out the required fields in the "New User" section, check the "Enabled" checkbox, and click "Save User" to create a new user.
- The table should update to include the new user's information immediately after saving.
